            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas the Carriers between the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the City of <hi>London,</hi> to the great Prejudice of the Members of the ſaid Univerſity, and Others, have for divers years laſt paſt exacted what Rates they pleaſed for the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Goods and Letters, (and have aggravated this their Unreaſonable Practice by requiring greater Summes from Scholars, then Townſ-men) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Charters, and Antient Priviledges of the ſaid Univerſity, and to the Orders faſt preſcribed to them in the year 1666.</p>
            <p>For the Prevention of theſe, and other Abuſes and Irregularities for the future, It is therefore now Ordered, That henceforth They, their Servants, and Porters, ſhall demand, or receive no greater Rates then ſuch as are hereafter expreſſed:

                  <item>II. For the Carriage of any <hi>Perſon</hi> by <hi>Waggon,</hi> Four Shillings.</item>
                  <item>III. For the Carriage of the <hi>Greatest Parcel</hi> (all being to be eſteemed <hi>Parcels</hi> under one quarter of an Hundred Weight) One Shilling: and ſo leſs in proportion for thoſe that are <hi>leſs;</hi> except that for the Carriage of a ſingle <hi>Hat</hi> and <hi>Caſe,</hi> Nine Pence.</item>
                  <item>IV. For the Carriage of any <hi>Burden,</hi> not exceeding one Hundred Weight, nor leſs than one quarter of a Hundred Weight, from the Shop or Warehouſe where the Goods were unladen, unto the Owners Habitation, or Shop, Three Pence: and for a <hi>Parcel,</hi> One Penny.</item>
                  <item>V. All Letters directed to Scholars ſhall be left at the Butteries of their reſpective Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges or Halls; and, for the delivery of every ſuch Letter, ſhall be given onely one Half-penny Loaf, as was accuſtomed. But if any Carriage comes with a Letter, nothing ſhall be given for the bringing of that Letter.</item>
                  <item>VI. Moreover, It is hereby ſtrictly Ordered, That all ordinary Stage-Coaches travelling between the ſaid Univerſity and City of <hi>London</hi> in Two Days, ſhall reſpectively ſet forth from <hi>Oxford,</hi> at, or before the Hour of Nine in the Morning by <hi>St. Mary</hi>'s Clock: and ſhall in like manner ſet forth from <hi>London,</hi> ſo as to paſs by <hi>St. Giles</hi>'s Church in the Suburbs, at or before the ſame Hour, by the Clock of the ſaid Church: And in all other Points, the Carriers are to take care, that Paſſengers be conveyed to their reſpective Stages, ſafe, and in Seaſonable Time.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>If any thing, contrary to the fore-mentioned Orders, ſhall be hereafter practiſed by any of the ſaid Carriers, let the Offenders expect to undergo due Puniſhment; and alſo to make Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Party injured, according to Right and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>And that all Perſons concerned (whether Inhabitants in <hi>Oxford,</hi> or elſewhere) may be better adviſed of the Contents hereof, it is required, That the reſpective Carriers do Openly and Publickly in their Common Ware-Houſes, within the ſaid Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> paſte up Printed Copies of theſe Preſents; and from time to time renew the ſame, if by any means they ſhall happen to be defaced or removed.</p>
            <p>Carriage by <hi>Water</hi> is to be eſtimated after the Rate of <hi>One Shilling</hi> for every Hundred Weight.</p>
